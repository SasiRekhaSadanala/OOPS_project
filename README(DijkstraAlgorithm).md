Overview:
This project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest travel paths between cities based on a dataset of city connections and distances. The algorithm computes the optimal route from a specified starting city to other cities, making it applicable for real-world navigation, logistics, and infrastructure planning.

Applications:
Navigation Systems: Efficient route suggestions for GPS systems.
Emergency Response: Rapid route calculations to minimize response time.
Logistics Optimization: Reducing delivery costs by finding shortest paths.
Urban Planning: Identifying critical routes for infrastructure improvements.
