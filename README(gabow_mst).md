Project Overview:
This project analyzes Twitter’s social network structure by applying Gabow’s Strongly Connected Components (SCC) algorithm and Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. By identifying core communities and influential connections, we gained insights into user connectivity patterns and influence pathways within Twitter’s network.

Strongly Connected Components (SCC): This step identifies dense communities within Twitter, highlighting interconnected groups and underlying clusters.
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): Using the SCC output, we applied MST to distill Twitter’s network into minimal, crucial links, emphasizing key user connections and influence channels.

Applications:

Platform Insights: Provides core user-group identification, allowing Twitter and Instagram to optimize their network structure for user engagement.
User Recommendations: Supports more accurate recommendations based on strong, identified user clusters.
Content Spread Optimization: Facilitates efficient content delivery through essential network paths, enhancing message reach.
